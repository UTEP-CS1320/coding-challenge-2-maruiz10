### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

The first step I took is to handle the case for systolic pressure being less than the diastolic pressure. This was easy enough, just an if statement to check which was greater. If diastolic pressure is less than systolic pressure, the remainder of the program runs. Next, the a series of else if statements check for the range of each number. It checks both varibles, and utilizes the "and" and "or" operators depending on the information given. The program runs the values through each statement to determine the range and outputs the associated category.
